# PropertySmart-Website-PWA

This is the official website and progressive web application for my final year project. The website (now web-application) features an installable feature that enables it to work as a native application on both desktop and mobile phone (which was the initial plan for the project: to be cross-platform)

## Tools used

- django-pwa
- Postgresql
- cloud-spanner (for backup of data to Google Cloud Storage in a seasonal basis)

## Guide to using Google Cloud Spanner Package for Django

The link on how to use django-google-spanner is available in the link [here](https://pypi.org/project/django-google-spanner/)
